# Club-Programs

This GitHub reposity will hold all the programs that we use in IoT club, allowing students to download and test the code themselves. Our meerings are in Pickett 105 on Mondays, and our official website is http://www.shsiot.club.

To run this code, you will need a laptop with Arduino downloaded from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Donate (click "Just Download"). Download the program, then open it with the ARduino program. Click Tools > Port then select the one with an Arduino. CLick the right arrow to load the code, then click Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M to open the Serial Monitor and see the data that is being outputted(if any).
